Once upon a time, there was a lonely girl living in a tall tower. She had her own kitchen, bathroom, clothes, and other necessities she needed. However, what she wanted most was to go outside. Her mother tells her she can't go outside because it is too dangerous. Today is the day her mother is out for the entire day, thus she will explore the outside. 

The fresh air made her thrilled. She was so happy to enojoy the nature. She did not understand why her mother did not allow her to go outside. However, minutes later, she felt there was something wrong with her body.

She noticed that her left arm is melting into some kind of unknowd liquid. Transparent, tiny worms came  out from her right arm, slowly crawling to her body. She was scared and terrified, screaming out loudly.
